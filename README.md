# PythonQuiz

# Origin
    I have been exporing various ways in which I enjoy learning and are also effective. This repo represents one of the methods by which I learn. That is to create questions based on the material at hand, and to examine and quiz myself at a later date. I hope to share these quizes with anyone interested in learning from them, and/or expanding them.

# Goals
    This collection is far from where I'd like it to be. Ideally...
        > The quizes should be focused with respect to portions of Python covered.
        > The questions should be more open-ended, with the intention of encouraging understanding of the question itself.
        > There should be no hand holding by removing URLs and make sure questions do not imply an answer.

     This collection will be evolving, as I imagine it lacks information about Python. In light of this, please, fork the repo and add to the collection, or if you have suggestions for me, feel free to reach out.
